<h1>Who's that then?</h1>
<p>Oh, ow! Well, how'd you become king, then? Well, Mercia's a temperate zone! You don't vote for kings.</p>
<p><strong>The Lady of the Lake, her arm clad in the purest shimmering samite, held aloft Excalibur from the bosom of the water, signifying by divine providence that I, Arthur, was to carry Excalibur.</strong> <em> That is why I am your king.</em> Knights of Ni, we are but simple travelers who seek the enchanter who lives beyond these woods.</p>
<h2>Well, I got better.</h2>
<p>The Lady of the Lake, her arm clad in the purest shimmering samite, held aloft Excalibur from the bosom of the water, signifying by divine providence that I, Arthur, was to carry Excalibur. That is why I am your king. What a strange person.</p>

<li>Burn her anyway!</li><li>Burn her anyway!</li><li>We shall say 'Ni' again to you, if you do not appease us.</li>

<h3>Be quiet!</h3>
<p>We want a shrubbery!! Burn her! What a strange person. I don't want to talk to you no more, you empty-headed animal food trough water! I fart in your general direction! Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries! Now leave before I am forced to taunt you a second time!</p>
