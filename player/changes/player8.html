<p>Oh, ow! Well, how'd you become king, then? Well, Mercia's a temperate zone! You don't vote for kings.</p>
<p><strong>The Lady of the Lake, her arm clad in the purest shimmering samite, held aloft Excalibur from the bosom of the water, signifying by divine providence that I, Arthur, was to carry Excalibur.</strong> <em> That is why I am your king.</em> Knights of Ni, we are but simple travelers who seek the enchanter who lives beyond these woods.</p>
<h2>Well, I got better.</h2>
<p>The Lady of the Lake, her arm clad in the purest shimmering samite, held aloft Excalibur from the bosom of the water, signifying by divine providence that I, Arthur, was to carry Excalibur. That is why I am your king. What a strange person.</p>
