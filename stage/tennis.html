        <p> Serena Williams has recently released a full tennis instructional video course on Masterclass.com. I've had a chance to review the course and wanted to share my thoughts on it. (Disclosure: The links in this article are affiliate links which means that if you follow them and decide to purchase the course, I receive a small commission.) My first impression is that it's highly professionally developed with high quality video and multiple cameras shooting Serena Williams from different angles. The website experience is also very efficient with simple, clean and intuitive navigation and movements through various lessons. Serena Williams Masterclass course. Serena's video course includes 10 lessons: Introduction, Groundstroke Fundamentals, Mastering Groundstrokes, Controlling the Court, Mental Toughness, Net Play, Training, Game Day, Making of a Winner, The Serve. Currently you can also download the workbook on the serve which includes key instructions and suggested drills for improving your tennis serve. You are also able to comment and ask questions in each lesson and possibly even receive an answer from the great Serena Williams herself. Learning Groundstrokes From Serena. The first two major lessons after the introduction focus on groundstrokes which we all know are Serena's weapons as she can hit winners off her forehand and backhand side with ease as soon as she sets her self up in a good position. Here are some key instructions from Serena that I really liked. These are real gems in terms of learning the strokes if you really pay attention to what she says. She instructs the viewer to: Turn well on the forehand when preparing and use your body weight going into the shot when hitting the forehand rather than using your arm a lot Keep your elbow high on the follow-through so that you can lift the ball easily over the net Complete long follow-through as this helps you play the ball deep Keep your head still even after contact because this helps you stay balanced throughout the stroke To improve your two-handed backhand, have someone feed you balls and hit them only with your non-dominant hand (left for righthanders) as backhand is all about your non-dominant hand</p>
